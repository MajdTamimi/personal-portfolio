      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Hey! I'm excited to welcome you to my portfolio, I am excited to
        share my
        interests and experiences with you.<br>
        Although I am still a student, I choose to be active in many fields and gain knowledge,this
        was
        through my participation in many technical trainings that were held either on the university
        campus or outside it, such as problem solving training, web development and Design patterns
        training.<br>
        But my journey is not over. I believe it has not begun yet.<br><br>
